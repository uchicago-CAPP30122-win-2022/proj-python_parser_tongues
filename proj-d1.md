## Project - Develiverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
Idea 1:
Visualize/Calculate the Impact of Climate Change on Housing Prices. Specific goals: Aggregate housing price data by geographical unit (zip code?). Make algorithm that models effects of climate change catastrophe by geographical unit (floods, hurricane, etc) Adjust the median housing price of geographical unit based off future value with catastrophic damage.

It's going to be hard to gather information about housing prices without having to pay to some degree for the data. I like this idea but I'm bit worried about the amount of time it will take to gather the necessary data within the time you have left for the quarter. 



Idea 2:
Project Modeling Covid-19 New Vaccinations (First Dose).  The goal would be to analyze political party affiliation between newly vaccinated individuals for their first dose and US States primary election data.  Our goal would be to identify correlation between political leanings and vaccination to see if any of the new first-dose vaccinated individuals are connected to any particular political party, and also to see if there is a particular political party that is preventing the US from reaching its goal of vaccinating the entire country.

Great idea! There's a lot data out there for COVID research so it'll be easier to perform your analysis for this project. There's also more information on political party leanings towards vaccinations so it'll be easy to gather that data too. I think this is a plausible idea within the time you have left in the course. 



Idea 3:
There is an unprecedented labor shortage since the pandemic, and economists have different views on whatâ€™s driving this phenomenon. Our goal is to explore job search platforms by scraping sites like Indeed and LinkedIn to analyze labor market trends such as which industries have higher labor shortages and the gap between employer and employee searches.
----
I'm a bit worried about this idea because it's going to be quite hard to scrap Indeed and LinkedIn because I'm pretty sure they have mechanisms built in to stop the scraping. Although, I think this is a great idea. It just might be hard to gather the data you need. 

Overall, I would go with Idea #2 because it's easier to gather the data and perform analysis on that data.
